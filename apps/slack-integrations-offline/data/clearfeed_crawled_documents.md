Overview
AI Agents in ClearFeed act as intelligent helpers in Slack, offering accurate answers by tapping into your linked knowledge sources. They're fully configurable and understand context, so responses feel natural and helpful. Beyond Q&A, they can also take actions—like creating JIRA tickets or updating deals in HubSpot—right from the conversation.
Each AI Agent can be customized and configured at the **Collection level** , allowing teams to tailor the behavior, data access, and tool integration of the AI for different support workflows.

Pricing
ClearFeed’s AI Agent capabilities depend on your plan and whether you have the **AI Pack** add-on.
On the **Professional and Enterprise plans** , the AI Pack is included at no extra cost. You can create AI Agents that integrate with your tools, take automated actions, and provide answers to common questions using Knowledge Sources.
On the **Starter plan** , AI Agents, Knowledge Sources, and AI-powered Automations are not available unless you add the AI Pack. With the AI Pack, Starter customers unlock the ability to create and use AI Agents and Knowledge Sources. The add-on costs **$20 per month per account** and can be purchased during upgrade or at any later stage.
Starter customers can also request a **one-time AI Pack trial** , typically lasting 14 days. During the trial, all AI Pack features are enabled. After it ends, access to AI Agents and Knowledge Sources is revoked, and you will need to upgrade or purchase the AI Pack to continue using them.
